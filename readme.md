#Personal portfolio website

Initially I inttended to present one page that had all the techniques we have learnt so far, however I found that if I were to have everything on one page it becsme unweildly and harder to organise and present. Therefore I have made a main page and a few other pages that showcase different methods of presenting information. 

## Nav bar

On the main page the nav bar enables the user to smooth scroll to any section on the page, but once you goto a new page the nav bar changes. Instead of a smooth scroll through the page you are able to navigate to other pages. I thought this would increase userbility as it enables users to go through the site without having to go back to the front page each time.

### Main page

At the top of the page, there is a picture banner which I was going to use to link through to a new page, the main page, although I know how to do this I decided against it. Following this there is a small about me with two icons that respond to the page scroll as well as the hover effect. Then there are four pictures that show additional information when you hover over, it also has a purple overlsy to help the readabiltiy. Then there is the hobbies section, this is my portfolio of differnt pages with differnt topics, but a similar style to the main page. These sections link to new pages and have icons that are responsive in the same manner. At the end of every section there is a contact me section which contains an email me button which should open in the users email and be populated. This section also links to my facebook and github with responsive icons.

### Camping & Hiking

This page is a informative page with maps of the locations as well a couple of pictures that allow the users to recognize locations if they were to visit. Its basic layout is two coloumns, but the top section of the left coloumn is split once more to enable the display of information and pictures.

### Cooking

This page is a little show case of the food I like to cook, the information is displayed in coloumns and the pictures are circular in shape using CSS. With this in mind I make use of borders to make the page appear fuller.

### Travel

This page is essentially a small gallery which has a shadow overlay over the picture, this overlay is lifted once you hover over them, moreover they will pop out at you as well on hover, with a CSS scole of 1.1, if you were to click on these images they would open to full resolution in a new page.

## Pets

As I own pets I thought that a few pictures and a little information woould allow me to show case some different skills, like offsetting photos as well as linking new pages. If I had additional time and resources I would have put up a video or two so you could see them live, in action, sadly it was not good enough quality.
### What I missed

Parralax systems looks very cool, but I was unable to implement in into the page as by the time that 
I found out how to do it, I had finished about 90% of the Website, I would also like to style the page a little more to make it less blocky. 
For my travel gallery I should have taken more time to fix the small size of my images so that they were all the same size, moreover I would have liked to incorperate some buttons to enable users to move through the full resolution photos without having to go back to the travel page.
